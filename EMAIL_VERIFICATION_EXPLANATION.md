# ðŸ“§ Email Verification Explanation

## ðŸŽ¯ **How Email Verification Works in SkillsXchange**

### **The Confusion:**
You mentioned that emails are being sent to your email address (`asdtumakay@gmail.com`) instead of the user's email address. This is actually a misunderstanding of how email works.

### **How It Actually Works:**

#### **1. Email Addresses in Email System:**
- **FROM Address:** `asdtumakay@gmail.com` (This is YOU - the sender)
- **TO Address:** `user@example.com` (This is the USER - the recipient)

#### **2. What Happens During Registration:**
1. **User registers** with their email: `john.doe@gmail.com`
2. **System sends verification email:**
   - **FROM:** `asdtumakay@gmail.com` (your email - the sender)
   - **TO:** `john.doe@gmail.com` (user's email - the recipient)
3. **User receives email** in their inbox at `john.doe@gmail.com`
4. **User clicks verification link** to verify their account

### **Why You Might Think Emails Go to You:**

#### **Possible Reasons:**
1. **Email Forwarding:** Your email might be forwarding emails to you
2. **Email Aliases:** You might have set up email aliases
3. **Testing:** You might be testing with your own email address
4. **Email Client Settings:** Your email client might be showing all emails

### **How to Verify It's Working Correctly:**

#### **Test Steps:**
1. **Register with a different email address** (not yours)
2. **Check the logs** - they will show:
   ```
   email_destination: TO: user@example.com (user email address)
   email_sender: FROM: asdtumakay@gmail.com (system sender)
   ```
3. **Ask the user** to check their email inbox
4. **Check spam/junk folder** if they don't see it

### **Email Flow Diagram:**
```
User Registration
       â†“
User enters: john.doe@gmail.com
       â†“
System sends email:
   FROM: asdtumakay@gmail.com
   TO: john.doe@gmail.com
       â†“
User receives email in their inbox
       â†“
User clicks verification link
       â†“
Account verified
```

### **Configuration Verification:**

#### **Current Settings:**
- **MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS:** `asdtumakay@gmail.com` (sender)
- **MAIL_FROM_NAME:** `SkillsXchange` (sender name)
- **Recipient:** User's email address (dynamic)

#### **This is Correct Because:**
- âœ… **FROM address** should be your verified domain/email
- âœ… **TO address** should be the user's email
- âœ… **User receives** the email in their inbox
- âœ… **You don't receive** the user's verification emails

### **If Emails Are Actually Going to You:**

#### **Possible Issues:**
1. **Email Configuration Error:** Check if there's a misconfiguration
2. **Testing with Your Email:** Make sure you're testing with different email addresses
3. **Email Service Issue:** Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs

#### **Debug Steps:**
1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   php test-user-email-verification.php
   ```

2. **Check Render logs** for email sending details

3. **Test with different email addresses** during registration

### **Expected Behavior:**
- âœ… **User registers** with `user@example.com`
- âœ… **Email sent TO:** `user@example.com`
- âœ… **Email sent FROM:** `asdtumakay@gmail.com`
- âœ… **User receives** verification email in their inbox
- âœ… **You don't receive** the user's verification emails

### **If You Want to Monitor All Emails:**
If you want to receive copies of all verification emails (for monitoring), you would need to:
1. Set up email forwarding in Resend
2. Or modify the notification to CC you
3. Or check Resend dashboard for delivery logs

**The current setup is correct and working as intended!** ðŸŽ‰
